# HOME üèò AUTOMATION ü§ñ SANDBOX üí•

It's an experiment. If you're planning to use this, don't.

The main branch is outdated, the current work-in-progress version is [the `erden` branch](https://github.com/kunaakos/home-sandbox/tree/erden). That one includes a massive rewrite: rest+websocket apis were replaced with a federated GraphQl setup, and it adds support for bluetooth devices (but at what cost!).

### current goals

A whole bunch of admin UI needs to be written to replace hardcoded configs (easy), and some bluetooth related issues to be solved (not easy) before the `erden` branch is merged.

### long-term goals

This started off as a simple node.js script but snowballed into this entire project. I stuck with vanilla JS because it allowed me to move quickly at first, and write all kinds of hacky but concise code, but I will refactor using TypeScript. I'm also thinking of using [nact](https://nact.io/), because it makes tons of sense for what this project does.

### a more stable version

After the above are done, the project shall be documented and reborn, but first I need to settle in a new home before I continue working on it. Byeee!
